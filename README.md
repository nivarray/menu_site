This is my first readme file go easy on me.

This project will serve as a simple menu for Ysa's baking business.
More specifically this will be about her cookies.

About us description

Explain the type of business
How this business sticks out (for example, say something like combines popular flavors to create interesting twists, and created new flavor biscoff butter).


Some of the desired features(NOW):
- Display all types of cookies
- Prices
- Images of each cookie
- Sold Out or not
- "Almost Sold out"
- Layout
Later:
- Keeping track of orders
- When someone tries to put in an order, prompt for the following:
    > pick up date
    > if its a cake, ask customer for how many people 
- Create a section with just reviews (most likely another page)


Will use the Flask Framework for Python for backend, and will use JS, HTML, and CSS for front end.

Eventually, will keep track of inventory using a RDBMS. MYSQL.


"Special" features (not necessary at first):
- when hovering over a cookie, a review will show up about the cookie, making the experience unique.
