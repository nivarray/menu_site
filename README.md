This is my first readme file go easy on me.

This project will serve as a simple menu for Ysa's baking business.
More specifically this will be about her cookies.
Some of the desired features:
- Display all types of cookies
- Prices
- Images of each cookie
- 

Will use the Flask Framework for Python for backend, and will use JS, HTML, and CSS for front end.

Eventually, will keep track of inventory using a RDBMS. MYSQL.
