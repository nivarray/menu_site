This is my first readme file go easy on me.

This project will serve as a simple menu for Ysa's baking business.
More specifically this will be about her cookies.
Some of the desired features:
- Display all types of cookies
- Prices
- Images of each cookie
- Create a section with just reviews (most likely another page)


Will use the Flask Framework for Python for backend, and will use JS, HTML, and CSS for front end.

Eventually, will keep track of inventory using a RDBMS. MYSQL.


"Special" features (not necessary at first):
- when hovering over a cookie, a review will show up about the cookie, making the experience unique.
